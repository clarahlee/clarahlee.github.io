<h2>Would my child benefit from services from KARE 2 Communicate? </h2>
<p>Does your child move, talk, learn, and eat like other children his or her age? Have teachers, physicians, or other caregivers expressed concerns about your child’s development? K2C staff can help you determine if speech therapy evaluation is needed. If you have questions or concerns, our therapists are available to help address them. If you would like to know more about our therapy services, call and talk to an experienced therapists in person!</p>
<h2>What is the process by which my child will receive services?</h2>  
<p>To beginning therapy at K2C:

    Call us at (919) 358-2185, or 919-493-1974. Our helpful office staff will ask you simple questions about the services you are looking for, as well as insurance information, and will schedule an evaluation appointment. Have your insurance card handy when you call! You will conveniently obtain a Parent Packet via mail or email. Please fill it out and return it before your scheduled evaluation.
   <br> Your evaluation appointment will include:
     <br>Formal and informal evaluations
    <br>Parent and child interviews
    <br>Parent-therapist collaboration regarding your child’s current skills and challenges, and how K2C can help!
    <br>Following the evaluation, your therapist will discuss recommendations and provide you with a copy of the evaluation report. If further therapy is recommended, your child will be seen at a frequency that is decided by you, your therapist, and your child’s physician, to address his/her needs in a fun and playful way during treatment and home activities. If therapy is not recommended, you and your child will be provided with ideas and  suggestions to use at home and in the community.</p>
