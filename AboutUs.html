    <p>Teresa Erickson founded KARE 2 COMMUNICATE (K2C) to assist families in the Chapel Hill, Durham, Roxboro, and surrounding areas with obtaining 
      quality speech therapy services.  Teresa works with children in their natural environments including homes, preschools, and daycare centers. 
      The practice focuses on making sure that every client receives the most appropriate services and that K2C maintains a high standard of excellence.
       Providing solutions that allow children to reach their full potential in all areas of communication and enhance success is our goal. 
       Teresa is a Pediatric Speech-Language Pathologist, who holds a Master degree in Communication Disorders, is ASHA certified (CCC), and is licensed 
       in the state of North Carolina. She participates in continuing education on relevant, timely topics as well as on current therapy techniques and approaches to provide up to date services according to best practice. KARE 2 COMMUNICATE offers comprehensive assessment and treatment plans for a range of childhood speech and language disorders from infancy through elementary school. Our highly qualified therapists provide individualized intervention in fun, play based activities to optimize success. Play is a childâ€™s work.</p>  
<p>At K2C, we evaluate each infant or child to determine strengths and weaknesses, address family concerns, and develop an individual treatment plan that will incorporate the most appropriate therapy approaches and techniques for your child. We educate families on the techniques that are utilized during sessions and then provide ideas for carryover into your daily activities. In working with children, we focus on developing functional language skills to ease the frustration in communication for both the child and parents. Children learn skills to communicate effectively with peers, teachers, and community helpers. Goals are often reached by using play-based, child-centered, family-friendly approaches. We would love the opportunity to work with you and your child.</p>
