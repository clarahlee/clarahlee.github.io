<h2 id="q9">How is therapy at K2C different than therapy offered at school?</h2>
School therapy is generally conducted in a group setting which is especially effective for pragmatic skills; therapy in our private practice is one-on-one and individualized to your child’s specific needs. Therapy services at K2C will focus on the many roles of a child’s life within their home, school, and community activities to ensure communication as well as academic success. If your child receives therapy at school he/she may qualify for additional speech and language services based on the severity and need of their delay or disability through a private practice.

Have your insurance card handy when you call! You will conveniently obtain a Parent Packet via mail or email. Please fill it out and return it before your scheduled evaluation.</p>

   <p> Following the evaluation, your therapist will discuss recommendations and provide you with a copy of the evaluation report.
